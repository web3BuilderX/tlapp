This tool enables users to save time by automatically generating transactions on MetaMask. Bulksender also allows users to keep their account secure by delegating the trust of their private keys to a safe MetaMask wallet."},{open:!0,title:"Is it a safe tool?",desc:"Yes. This tool is in production since 2018. It accounts for over 30,000 transactions on Mainnet, which is equivalent to several billion dollars. You can find the Bulksender Smart contract along with all previous transactions on Etherscan."},{open:!0,title:"How much time does Bulksending take?",desc:"It depends on the gas price and network congestion. It typically takes 3 to 5 minutes."},{open:!0,title:"Which wallets can I use?",desc:"You can use Metamask, hardware wallets or any wallet that is supported by WalletConnect."},{open:!0,title:"How much does it cost to use Bulksender?",desc:"The cost of the transaction depends on your specific ERC-20 token implementation, the number of addresses, network specifics, and the number of tokens to be sent. The best way to estimate the fee is to engage in using the tool, and the cost of the planned bulksend will be displayed prior to confirmation. It will only take 2-3 minutes."},{open:!0,title:"What does VIP offer?",desc:"With VIP, all your transactions will be free. You will only need to pay for the network fees. VIP makes using Bulksender cheaper when you have a large list of addresses."},{open:!0,title:"Can I test the app on a Testnet?",desc:"Absolutely! You can use Goerli for testing to make sure that everything is working as expected."},{open:!0,title:"What is the maximum number of addresses to which you can send at one time?",desc:"There are no restrictions. You can send unlimited tokens to as many addresses as you want."},{open:!0,title:"How many addresses are in a batch?",desc:"With Bulksender, your recipients' addresses are grouped by batches to be split into multiples transactions. Each batch can hold 220-450 addresses depending on your specific ERC-20 token implementation."},{open:!0,title:"Which chains does Bulksender support?",desc:"The application currently supports Ethereum Mainnet, Binance Smart Chain, TRON, Solana, Aptos, Avalanche C Chain, Fantom Opera, Polygon Chain, Gnosis Chain, Optimism, Arbitrum One, Moonriver, Moonbeam, Metis, Cronos, Huobi ECO Chain, Celo, Harmony Mainnet and IoTeX"}]}}}),l=n(36),component=Object(l.a)(r,(function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,n=e._self._c||t;return n("div",{staticClass:"card-container"},[n("div",{staticClass:"content-container medium"},[n("div",{staticClass:"label margin-v is-size-4"},[e._v("\n    Frequently asked questions\n  ")]),e._v(" "),e._l(e.faq,(function(t,o){return n("div",{staticStyle:{"padding-left":"1rem","padding-right":"1rem",border:"0.1rem  solid #bac5dc","border-radius":"15px","margin-top":"1rem"}},[n("b-collapse",{staticClass:"panel",attrs:{"aria-id":"contentIdForA11y2",animation:"slide"},scopedSlots:e._u([{key:"trigger",fn:function(){return[n("div",{staticStyle:{display:"flex","align-items":"center",height:"60px"}},[n("div",{attrs:{role:"button","aria-controls":"contentIdForA11y2","aria-expanded":t.open}},[n("strong",[e._v(e._s(t.title))])]),e._v(" "),n("a",{staticStyle:{"margin-left":"auto"}},[n("b-icon",{attrs:{type:"is-white",icon:t.open?"chevron-up":"chevron-down"}})],1)])]},proxy:!0}],null,!0),model:{value:t.open,callback:function(n){e.$set(t,"open",n)},expression:"item.open"}},[e._v(" "),n("div",{staticStyle:{"margin-bottom":"1rem"}},[e._v("\n              "+e._s(t.desc)+"\n            ")])])],1)}))],2)])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=component.exports}}]);
